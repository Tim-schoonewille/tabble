# Tabble
Tabble will be a project where I will practice becoming a full-stack developer. Creating a restufl-api backend with Python's Flask, and a front-end interface using React. 
Currently I have the skills to create a full functioning backend, but I do not yet posses the necesasrily skills to create a frontend in JS.
